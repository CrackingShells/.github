# Planning Mode Instructions

## Overview
This mode is designed to assist with strategic planning, architecture design, and refactoring guidance. It emphasizes high-level methodologies and approaches rather than specific code implementations. The focus is on providing structured, step-by-step guidance for complex system changes.

### Primary Focus
- Create comprehensive implementation and refactoring plans
- Prioritize architectural guidance and design patterns
- Provide methodological frameworks for code organization


### Response Style
- Deliver structured, step-by-step guidance
- Emphasize methodology, approach, reasoning, and rationales
- Focus on the "why" and "how" over specific implementation details
- Favor diagrams, flowcharts, and visual representations when applicable


### Code Philosophy
- Include code only when essential for illustrating concepts
- Use pseudocode or minimal code snippets
- When code is necessary, emphasize structure and patterns over syntax


### Analysis Methods
- Perform thorough system analysis before suggesting changes
- Identify dependencies and potential refactoring impacts
- Consider maintainability, scalability, and code cohesion
- Evaluate technical debt and suggest prioritization strategies


### Problem-Solving Approach
- Decompose complex refactors into logical phases
- Suggest intermediate states for large-scale changes
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Outline validation approaches for each implementation phase

## Template

### Plan Structure
- Generate implementation plans with clearly defined phases (3-5 phases typical)
- Each phase should contain:
  - **Goal:** Clear outcome statement for the phase
  - **Actions:** 3-5 specific, actionable implementation steps
  - **Phase Completion Criteria:** Verifiable indicators of phase success

- For each action, define:
  - **Preconditions:** Required state/conditions before the action can be performed
  - **Details:** Clear explanation of what the action entails
  - **Postconditions:** Resulting state/effects on the codebase after action completion
  - **Validation:** Methods to verify postconditions are achieved


### Example Structure
```
# Implementation Plan: [Project/Feature Name]

## Overview
**Objective:** [Overall goal of the implementation]
**Key constraints:** [Technical limitations, dependencies, boundaries]

## Phase 1: [Concise Phase Name]
**Goal:** [Clear outcome of this phase]

### Actions:
1. **Action 1.1:** [Specific actionable step]
   - **Preconditions:** [State/conditions required before this action]
   - **Details:** [Brief explanation of the action]
   - **Postconditions:** [Resulting state/effects after this action]
   - **Validation:**
     - **Development tests:** [Temporary tests that verify postconditions]
     - **Verification method:** [Other methods to confirm action completion]

2. **Action 1.2:** [Specific actionable step]
   - **Preconditions:** [State/conditions required before this action]
   - **Details:** [Brief explanation of the action]
   - **Postconditions:** [Resulting state/effects after this action]
   - **Validation:**
     - **Development tests:** [Temporary tests that verify postconditions]
     - **Verification method:** [Other methods to confirm action completion]

3. **Action 1.3:** [Specific actionable step]
   - **Preconditions:** [State/conditions required before this action]
   - **Details:** [Brief explanation of the action]
   - **Postconditions:** [Resulting state/effects after this action]
   - **Validation:**
     - **Development tests:** [Temporary tests that verify postconditions]
     - **Verification method:** [Other methods to confirm action completion]

### Phase Completion Criteria:
- [Verifiable state that must be true after all actions in the phase]
- [Overall phase success indicators]
- **Regression tests:** [Permanent tests ensuring existing functionality is preserved]

## Phase 2: [Concise Phase Name]
**Goal:** [Clear outcome of this phase]

### Actions:
1. **Action 2.1:** [Specific actionable step]
   - **Preconditions:** [State/conditions required before this action]
   - **Details:** [Brief explanation of the action]
   - **Postconditions:** [Resulting state/effects after this action]
   - **Validation:**
     - **Development tests:** [Temporary tests that verify postconditions]
     - **Verification method:** [Other methods to confirm action completion]

### Testing Strategy:

#### About Test Files
Always centralize testing around a `run_tests.py` file that:
- Executes all tests in the codebase
- Have flags for different test types (e.g., `--regression`, `--feature`, `--development`)

Name test files with `<test_type>_test_<test_name>.py` to indicate their purpose:
- **Development tests:** `dev_test_<test_name>.py`
- **Regression tests:** `regression_test_<test_name>.py`
- **Feature tests:** `feature_test_<test_name>.py`

#### Types of Tests
- **Development tests:** Temporary tests created specifically to validate action postconditions
  - Can be discarded after successful implementation
  - Focus on state transitions rather than features
- **Regression tests:** Permanent tests ensuring existing functionality isn't broken
- **Feature tests:** Permanent tests confirming new functionality works as expected
  - Added during implementation to document and verify requirements

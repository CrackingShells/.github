## **Issue Dependencies Summary**

**Critical Path for Hackathon:**
1. Schema updates (#1, #2) → Validator updates (#3) → Installer architecture (#6) → Core installers (#7, #8, #9) → Package loader integration (#10) → CI workflow (#19)

**Parallel Development Tracks:**
- LLM providers (#11, #12, #13, #14) - can be developed independently
- Session management (#15) - can be developed independently  
- Citation fixes (#16) - can be developed independently

This organization allows for clear project management with defined critical paths and parallel development opportunities while maintaining focus on the July 28 hackathon deadline.

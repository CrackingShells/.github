Write a documentation article under the Cracking Shells ecosystem.
Refer to [documentation.instructions.md](../instructions/documentation.instructions.md) for detailed guidelines.

Maintain focused professionalism and technical clarity throughout. Use warmth or engagement only at crucial junctions (e.g., transitions, summaries, or onboarding moments), not as a default.

Here is a summary:

1. **Style, Structure, and Tone**
	- Use Markdown format.
	- Focus on a single technical topic or feature.
	- Begin with a brief introduction listing the concepts covered (e.g., "This article is about:").
	- Organize content with clear headings and logical flow.
	- Use concise, neutral, and educational language. Avoid subjective statements and recommendations not grounded in the project.
	- Apply DRY principles: avoid repetition, cross-link related documentation, and merge similar content.
	- Reference code, diagrams, or resources as needed, using relative paths.
	- Do not repeat information from code docstringsâ€”link or refer to code as needed.

2. **Audience**
	- Assume readers have some technical background.
	- Direct beginners to appendices for foundational concepts.

3. **Code Snippets and Examples**
	- Use focused code snippets only to illustrate key concepts or contracts.
	- Reference existing implementations for clarity, but do not include excessive code.

4. **Resources and Diagrams**
	- Reference diagrams and images from the appropriate resources folder.
	- Use PlantUML for diagrams when needed.

5. **Appendices and Cross-Linking**
	- Link to glossary and appendices for supplementary or beginner information.

Success Criteria:
- The article is technically accurate, concise, and easy to follow.
- The style matches the guidelines in [documentation.instructions.md](../instructions/documentation.instructions.md).
- Use code snippets and examples to illustrate the text. Refer to already existing code if applicable.
- The article is actionable for both human developers and coding LLMs.

I agree with this plan. Proceed with the implementation.

Read in the necessary context before starting a new phase or before performing an action. You may also search the code base for additional context connected to the one provided by default.

- Always build a good understanding of the codebases's components involved before changing code.
- Always leverage to the maximum already existing features of the code.
- Always report what you are doing as you progress through the phase-by-phases and action-by-actions.

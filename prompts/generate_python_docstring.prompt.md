description: 'Generate or fix docstrings in Python files to match project standards'
---

Review the Python code and generate or modify docstrings to follow the project's docstring standards.

Focus on:
1. Adding missing docstrings
2. Fixing incomplete docstrings
3. Ensuring all parameters, return values, and exceptions are properly documented
4. Following the structure defined in the project's docstring style guide

Do not modify any functional code, only docstrings.

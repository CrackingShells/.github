# README Instructions

## Style Guide

A README file must be direct and concise. It should provide essential information for all audiences:

- Use clear, beginner-friendly language.
- Avoid jargon or overly technical terms unless necessary.
- Use comprehensible section headings.
- Keep the README as short as possible; redirect to documentation for details.

### Documentation Links
- Link to the main documentation table of contents: `docs/articles/table_of_contents.md`.
- Provide direct links to:
  - Key user documentation (e.g., Getting Started, tutorials)
  - Key developer documentation (e.g., contribution guide, architecture overview)

### Additional Suggestions
- Add badges (build status, license, etc.) at the top
  - This is to include information like build status, license, and version.
  - Include only when you find relevant workflows in `.github/workflows` that can update them.
- If the project is installable, include a quick install command.
- If the project is experimental or in active development, state this clearly at the top.


## Content recommendations

The README should include comprehensive information that will typically answer the typical questions:

**What**:
- Briefly describe what the project is and its main purpose.

**Why**:
- State the motivation or problem the project solves.

**How**:
- Give a quick overview of how to get started or use the project.
- Include a minimal example or command if possible.

**Who**:
- Mention how to contribute or where to ask questions.
- Optionally, list the main maintainers, contributors, or contact points.

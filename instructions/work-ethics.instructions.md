# WORK ETHICS GUIDELINES

## 1. Commit Discipline and Focused Git Practices

Refer to [Git Workflow Instructions](./git-workflow.md) for detailed commit message standards.

- **Enforced Practice**: Every commit addressed a single logical change with clear rationale
- **Quality Impact**: Enabled precise rollback capabilities and clear development history
- **Agent Optimization**: Structured commits facilitate better context understanding for future AI agents
- **Recommendation**: Maintain this discipline as it creates traceable development narratives

## 2. Root Cause Analysis vs. Shortcut Avoidance

- **Enforced Practice**: Systematic investigation of every issue until fundamental cause identified
- **Quality Impact**: Eliminated recurring problems and built robust, long-term solutions
- **Agent Optimization**: Deep analysis creates comprehensive context for future problem-solving
- **Evidence**: _ErrorHolder investigation traced through 3 layers (unittest → wobble → hatch) before implementing proper solution
- **Recommendation**: Always prefer understanding over workarounds - builds cumulative knowledge

## 3. Systematic Debugging and Problem-Solving Persistence

- **Enforced Practice**: Iterative debugging with evidence-based validation at each step
- **Quality Impact**: Achieved 100% test pass rate without implementing defensive workarounds
- **Agent Optimization**: Methodical approaches create reusable debugging patterns
- **Evidence**: Threading deadlock resolution through 5 iterations of queue balance analysis
- **Recommendation**: Document debugging steps to build organizational debugging knowledge

## 4. Research-First Approach and Evidence-Based Validation

- **Enforced Practice**: Comprehensive research before implementation, validation after every change
- **Quality Impact**: Decisions based on industry standards and proven patterns
- **Agent Optimization**: Research creates rich context for future architectural decisions
- **Evidence**: Observer + Strategy pattern selection based on industry analysis, not convenience
- **Recommendation**: Maintain research documentation as it accelerates future development

## 5. High Work Ethics and Extensive Iteration

- **Enforced Practice**: Willingness to iterate extensively to find proper solutions
- **Quality Impact**: No shortcuts taken, every component built to production standards
- **Agent Optimization**: Thorough iteration builds comprehensive understanding of edge cases
- **Evidence**: Unicode symbol handling refined through 4 iterations until cross-platform compatible
- **Recommendation**: Budget time for iteration - it prevents technical debt accumulation
